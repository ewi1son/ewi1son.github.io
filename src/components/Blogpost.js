        This week has been an interesting one. Again, I feel like I didn’t get enough done. But at the same time I feel like I have learned the most this week. React is becoming more and more familiar, which is a somewhat reassuring feeling. However I constantly feel behind and I’m not sure if that will ever change.

        CLI’s are scary for many reasons. They aren’t necessarily intuitive, at least in the way most people are used to them. And you feel like if you mess up there is no going back. I would say that CLI’s are more intimidating than scary, but can be scary nonetheless.

        I keep looking back at where I was at the beginning of the program, and it does instill some confidence. Like I said before, I feel like I’ve learned a lot but don’t have the same to show for it. Looking back is what helps me realize what I’ve learned this far, and have to keep moving forward.
