        This week has been the most challenging week thus far. I feel like I will be saying that each week, which I expected. Just as I was feeling comfortable in JavaScript, react was thrown at us and it has truly been like drinking from a firehose.

        JavaScript frameworks seem very valuable, albeit confusing at first. I can see how React is going to play out and make my life easier, but so far it has been difficult.

        Learning how to be a devloper has been one of the more challenging things I've done. It is an entirely different style of learning. However slow it may be, I'm making progress. As long as I keep moving forward I'm happy.
