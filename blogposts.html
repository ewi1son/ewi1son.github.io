                 <h6>Week 1</h6>
                 <p>I feel like I understand the workflow for the most part but can get stuck on git branches.
                    Mapping out how branching works in my head can take a while but I usually can think through it.
                    After creating this blog, I now realize I need to freshen up on my HTML and CSS, which I know we
                    will be doing.<br>
                    <br>
                    I know that I currently understand barely enough to create a blog, but I see how potentially
                    powerful the tools we have been using can be. I am beginning to get an idea of what all goes into
                    web development,
                    and while it is intimidating, it is also exciting.
                 </p>

                 <h6>Week 2</h6>
                 <p>
                    Pseudo coding was a much different experience than I had expected. Going into it I pictured it being
                    mostly plain english, with small amounts of “code speak” thrown in there to make it easier to
                    decipher.
                    However, while there was still some plain english, most ended up in “code speak” and there is some
                    type of structure to it. While this has made it more difficult than I anticipated, it will
                    definitely make writing the actual code easier.
                    Considering for all variable and functions seems impossible, but that is part of it. <br>
                    <br>
                    I feel like I am on the right track but know I need to explore pseudo coding more, which will
                    definitely come with time. <br>
                    <br>
                    Looking forward, I am both nervous and excited about learning JavaScript. I know that it will be
                    challenging, but I also know how powerful it can be. I am also excited to explore Bootstrap more,
                    because I know how that can change the approach to web design.

                 <p>
                    Seeing the breakdown of the three languages we have started to learn has been interesting. Going
                    into the program I had
                    some beginner exposure to both HTML and CSS, and the bare minimum to JavaScript. Even though I have
                    just started with JS,
                    it is easy to see how powerful it can be. It definitely makes sense why this will be the focus for
                    most of the front-end half of the bootcamp. <br>
                    <br>
                    This week I reworked almost every aspect of my blog, starting with scrapping the CSS and restarting.
                    I have also added a small amount of Bootstrap
                    and incorporated a nav bar with links to multiple pages. It is a very small step, but I enjoyed the
                    design and front-end aspect of the process.

                 <p>
                    JavaScript in one word: overwhelming. It’s not that JS is the hardest thing in the world, it’s just a lot at once. Before coming into the bootcamp I had used some HTML and CSS, but barely any JS. I would normally consider myself a fast learner, but JS has caused me to slow down and proceed cautiously. <br>
                    <br>
                    When learning the concepts seperately they are relatively easy to digest, however when they are all meshing together it gets overwhelming at times. JS to me has been a lot like golf, you can read as much as you want, watch other people as much as you want, but until you do it youself you won’t get any better. Before I started the projects I felt like I had somewhat of a grasp on JS concepts and syntax, but when I began I felt lost. I had to really slow down and review individual concepts so I could begin to form my own code.<br>
                    <br>
                    Biggest lesson learned this week is to slow down, spend time in each concept, and write small amounts of code early to get a handle on how they work together.
