                I feel like I understand the workflow for the most part but can get stuck on git branches.
                Mapping out how branching works in my head can take a while but I usually can think through it. After creating this blog, I now realize I need to freshen up on my HTML and CSS, which I know we will be doing.<br>
                <br>
                I know that I currently understand barely enough to create a blog, but I see how potentially powerful the tools we have been using can be. I am beginning to get an idea of what all goes into web development,
                and while it is intimidating, it is also exciting.

                    Pseudo coding was a much different experience than I had expected. Going into it I pictured it being mostly plain english, with small amounts of “code speak” thrown in there to make it easier to decipher.
                    However, while there was still some plain english, most ended up in “code speak” and there is some type of structure to it. While this has made it more difficult than I anticipated, it will definitely make writing the actual code easier. 
                    Considering for all variable and functions seems impossible, but that is part of it. <br>
                    <br>
                    I feel like I am on the right track but know I need to explore pseudo coding more, which will definitely come with time. <br>
                    <br>
                    Looking forward, I am both nervous and excited about learning JavaScript. I know that it will be challenging, but I also know how powerful it can be. I am also excited to explore Bootstrap more, because I know how that can change the approach to web design. <br>

                    Seeing the breakdown of the three languages we have started to learn has been interesting. Going into the program I had
                     some beginner exposure to both HTML and CSS, and the bare minimum to JavaScript. Even though I have just started with JS,
                     it is easy to see how powerful it can be. It definitely makes sense why this will be the focus for most of the front-end half of the bootcamp. <br>
                    <br>
                    This week I reworked almost every aspect of my blog, starting with scrapping the CSS and restarting. I have also added a small amount of Bootstrap 
                    and incorporated a nav bar with links to multiple pages. It is a very small step, but I enjoyed the design and front-end aspect of the process.
