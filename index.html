        </h3>
        <p>
          JavaScript in one word: overwhelming. It’s not that JS is the hardest thing in the world, it’s just a lot at once. Before coming into the bootcamp I had used some HTML and CSS, but barely any JS. I would normally consider myself a fast learner, but JS has caused me to slow down and proceed cautiously. <br>
          <br>
          When learning the concepts seperately they are relatively easy to digest, however when they are all meshing together it gets overwhelming at times. JS to me has been a lot like golf, you can read as much as you want, watch other people as much as you want, but until you do it youself you won’t get any better. Before I started the projects I felt like I had somewhat of a grasp on JS concepts and syntax, but when I began I felt lost. I had to really slow down and review individual concepts so I could begin to form my own code.<br>
          <br>
          Biggest lesson learned this week is to slow down, spend time in each concept, and write small amounts of code early to get a handle on how they work together.
