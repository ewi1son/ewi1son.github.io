  <p>My first week was about what I expected it to be. I knew that this entire course was going to feel like information overload, and week one did not disappoint.
  </p>
<p>I feel like I understand the workflow for the most part but can get stuck on git branches.
    Mapping out how branching works in my head can take a while but I usually can think through it. After creating this blog, I now realize I need to freshen up on my HTML and CSS, which I know we will be doing.
</p>
<p>
    I know that I currently understand barely enough to create a blog, but I see how potentially powerful the tools we have been using can be. I am beginning to get an idea of what all goes into web development,
    and while it is intimidating, it is also exciting.
